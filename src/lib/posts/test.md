Another year, another yearly review post. 2021 felt like pretty much 2020 part II for a lot of people, me included. The ongoing pandemic still affected our lives, and even though most people in my country are now vaccinated (including me), the danger still exists and preventive measures are still necessary. But it's nice to be able to start doing things and going places we haven't been able to for a while. I personally think this situation is still going to drag on for a while, but we'll adapt to it with time.
